fun with cuda
-------------

playing (and researching) cuda on c++ on old macOS 10.12.

To compile on macOS I'm using:
 - Apple Clang 8.0 from Xcode 8.2 (CommandLineTools is avaiable to download separatly) 
 - CUDA driver for macOS 10.12 -- 387 and CUDA Tookit for macOS 8.0.

Code is compatible with C++11 (because clang 8.0 doesn't supports C++14) and could be executed on different platform (like Windows and Linux) using newer versions of CUDA Toolkit.

goal

My goal for this point in time is find a task and solution to make it runs on the device faster than on the cpu.
